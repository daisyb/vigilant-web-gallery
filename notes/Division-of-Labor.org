** Front end - Daisy
- Slide show
- Side bar with other galleries

** Uploading - Krzysztof
- Main goal: Custom uploading software that ties into backend
- Stretch goal: Drag and drop uploading

** Database - David
- Database is SQLite
- Each gallery is stored as a table formated as such:

| User name    | Image name   | Image filepath      | Github link                  |
|--------------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------------|
| Sally Shears | Razor Blades | ../images/razor.png | github.com/mollymillions/mdl |
|              |              |                     |                              | 

- Should be get/set methods for each column
- Ability to delete row by image name
- Ability to delete table

** Documentation/Deployment/Testing - Nicholas
- Writing up documentation for future generations
- Deploying the app on a Digital Ocean box. Deployment should ideally by a simple python script (Fabric)
- Testing each bit of functionality, maybe basic security testing (SQL injection)
