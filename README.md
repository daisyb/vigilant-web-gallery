Ideas: use CSS
make option: sort by name
images go across the scren
javascript search box: seach by name
slideshow mode
random image from gallery 
fix the weird spacing
make gifs work
instead of pasting in code, pasting the github repo link
change scaling and sizing of the top image.(David thinks it's too big)
