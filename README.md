# vigilant-web-gallery
A web gallery for Mr. Dyrland-Weaver's Graphics class. Now with extra vigilance!

[Link the Mr. Dyrland-Weaver's Web gallery](https://nibbler.stuy.edu/webgallery/html/stuygal.html)

Ideas: use CSS
* make option: sort by name
* images go across the scren
* javascript search box: seach by name
* slideshow mode
* random image from gallery 
* fix the weird spacing
* make gifs work
* instead of pasting in code, pasting the github repo link
* change scaling and sizing of the top image.(David thinks it's too big)
* click image to zoom in like facebook or tumblr and then click left right to navigate through images
  * instead of big photo on top
* side panel to choose assignment page instead of nav bar
* home button in corner
* Decent color scheme
